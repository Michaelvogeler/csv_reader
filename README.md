For this assignment, we were given two separate CSV files (PyBank and PyPoll), and were instructed to find and print certain requirements. First, I had to import the OS and the CSV (for each file). Then, I established a list for each variable, with "[]" for each. I had to loop through each of the rows for each column in the respected columns to find each result.  # csv_reader
